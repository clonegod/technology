## Spinlock（自旋锁） - 获取锁暂时失败，但很可能马上会获取到，因此让申请锁的线程空转一会不放弃

### 自旋锁优化原理
大家知道，Java的多线程安全是基于Lock机制实现的，而Lock的性能往往不如人意。

原因是，monitorenter与monitorexit这两个控制多线程同步的bytecode原语，是JVM依赖操作系统互斥(mutex)来实现的。

互斥是一种会导致线程挂起，并在较短的时间内又必须重新调度回原线程的，较为消耗资源的操作。
为了避免进入OS互斥，Java6的开发者们提出了自旋锁优化。

自旋锁优化的原理是在线程进入OS互斥前，通过CAS自旋一定的次数来检测锁的释放。
如果在自旋次数未达到预设值前锁已被释放，则当前线程会立即持有该锁。



### 自旋锁的使用场景
	持有锁的线程能快速完成同步代码的执行，尽快释放锁，否则其它线程在自旋锁上将浪费大量的时间

A spinlock is a lock which causes a thread trying to acquire it to simply wait in a loop ("spin") while repeatedly checking if the lock is available. 
Since the thread remains active but is not performing a useful task, the use of such a lock is a kind of busy waiting.

Once acquired, spinlocks will usually be held until they are explicitly released, although in some implementations they may be automatically released if the thread being waited on (that which holds the lock) blocks, or "goes to sleep".

Because they avoid overhead（开销） from operating system process rescheduling or context switching（避免再次调用或线程上下文切换导致的开销）, spinlocks are efficient if threads are likely to be blocked for only short periods（线程所执行任务非常小，可以快速结束的情况下，使用自旋锁是比较高效的）. For this reason, operating-system kernels often use spinlocks. 

However, spinlocks become wasteful if held for longer durations, as they may prevent other threads from running and require rescheduling. The longer a thread holds a lock, the greater the risk that the thread will be interrupted by the OS scheduler while holding the lock. If this happens, other threads will be left "spinning" (repeatedly trying to acquire the lock), while the thread holding the lock is not making progress towards releasing it. The result is an indefinite（不确定） postponement（延期） until the thread holding the lock can finish and release it. This is especially true on a single-processor system, where each waiting thread of the same priority is likely to waste its quantum（配额） (allocated time where a thread can run) spinning until the thread that holds the lock is finally finished （如果一个线程占有了自旋锁，但没有快速释放锁，在单核cpu的情况下，就会造成其它等待锁释放的线程浪费掉被分配的cpu时间片。反言之，在多核cpu下，且申请到锁的线程能快速将同步代码执行完成并释放锁，使用自旋锁才更有优势）.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You would want to use a spinlock when you think it is cheaper to enter a busy waiting loop and pool a resource instead of blocking when the resource is locked.
通过执行一段busy waiting loop而不是以阻塞的方式等待锁资源。

Spinning can be beneficial when locks are fine grained（细粒度） and large in number (for example, a lock per node in a linked list) as well as when lock hold times are always extremely short. 
锁的粒度很小，数量很多（例如，链表中每个节点的锁），并且锁保持时间总是非常短，则旋转可能是有益的。

Spinlock, is a type of lock, which is non-block able & non-sleep-able. 
Any thread which want to acquire a spinlock for any shared or critical resource will continuously spin, wasting the CPU processing cycle till it acquire the lock for the specified resource. 
Once spinlock is acquired, it try to complete the work in its quantum and then release the resource respectively. 
Spinlock is the highest priority type of lock, simply can say, it is non-preemptive （非抢占式）kind of lock.
